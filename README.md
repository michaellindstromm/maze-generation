### TL;DR
* Maze randomly generated.
* Game created there after.
* Clone and play.

### Game
The premis of the game is there is a 'RED' character that is creating a maze in order to find the best place to hide his precious jewel. The user can choose from three difficulty levels: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD. The more difficult the less time to find the jewel! WARNING: HARD is hard!


### Generation 
The maze is generated by a recursive function and back tracking through a stack.
