# Maze Runner 

Maze Runner is a simple maze solver game. Built using javascript, p5.js, and canvas, the premis of the game is to race a simple computer AI to the gem hidden somewhere in the maze. Upon entry players are able to see the maze being generated through a recursive function and backtracking through a stack. After completion players choose their difficulty level, press play, and the race is on!
